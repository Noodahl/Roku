Roku.cs

This example program was created to investigate some of the API capabilities of ROKU.

It primarily was designed to leverage the ability to query the list of installed apps.

The HTTP client needed to make the approrpriate requests are included in the Roku.cs file.

The apps would then be dynamically set to Subpage Reference list digital signals, by modifying the Signal Name to the following format:
App: <AppName>-<AppID>

Additionally, the .png file of all the installed apps are stored on the processor in the HTML folder.

The included VTPro project, consists of the Subpage Reference list, which references a subpage containing a Dynamic Image Object.

When the apps are queried and the .png file stored on the processor, the Dynamic Image Objects in the Subpage Reference List, get updated to match the appropriate app image.

Finally, when one of the Image Objects are pressed, the Name gets parsed and the App is launched using the App ID.

Navigation functionality was also tested, using Custom Added Text Console Commands.

For testing purposes, the Console command has the following format:

MakeRequest <Request>

where request can be:
App - Query the Roku for the installed apps
Up
Down
Home
Launch <AppID> - Launch an App using its ID
